END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT
 
 
This End User License Agreement (this “Agreement”) is a legal agreement between you and Stanford University (“Stanford MobiSocial,” “we,” “us” or “our”) regarding Stanford MobiSocial Computing Lab’s Android application (“Musubi” or  the “App”) which you have chosen to download from the Google Play website located at https://play.google.com/store?hl=en.  The procedures for modifying or changing this Agreement in the future are discussed in Section 9.
 
1.         Your Use of the App.
 
You may use Musubi to, among other things, create a social network with your friends and colleagues on your Android device (“Mobile Device”) (collectively, the “Services”).  Once you download Musubi onto your Mobile Device and accept this Agreement, you may use the App and the Services.  
 
2.         Your Affirmative Representations.
 
By downloading or using Musubi, you represent and warrant that:  
 
(a)        your use of Musubi and the Services does not violate any applicable law or regulation; 
       (b)        you have the right to and are able to enter into this Agreement;
(c)        you will not impersonate any other person or entity or permit third parties to use your copy of Musubi;
(d)        you will not use Musubi or the Services to violate our or any other person’s rights including without limitation privacy rights, publicity rights, intellectual property rights (including without limitation copyrights) or contract rights; and
(e)        you will not use Musubi or the Services to distribute content that:  (i) is defamatory, damaging, disruptive, unlawful, inappropriate, offensive, inaccurate, pornographic, vulgar, indecent, profane, hateful, racially or ethnically offensive, obscene, lewd, lascivious, threatening, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable; (ii) incites, encourages or threatens immediate physical harm against another, including but not limited to, content that promotes racism, bigotry, sexism, religious intolerance or harm against any group or individual; or (iii) solicits personal information from anyone under 13 or exploits anyone in a sexual or violent manner.
 
3.         License Grant. 
 
We grant you a limited, terminable, non-sublicensable, non-transferable, non-exclusive license to install and use Musubi on any Mobile Device that you own or control solely for your personal use.  This Agreement will also govern any software upgrades provided by us that replace or supplement the original App, unless such upgrades are accompanied by a separate license, in which case the terms of that license will govern. 
 
4.         License Restrictions and Usage Rules.
 
You may not use Musubi on any Mobile Device that you do not own or control, and you may not distribute or make Musubi available over a network where it could be used by multiple devices at the same time.  You may not modify, copy, publish, rent, lease, lend, sell, redistribute, transfer or sublicense Musubi or otherwise commercialize Musubi or any information or software associated with Musubi.  You may not use Musubi on a service bureau basis.  You may not copy, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, modify or create derivative works of the App, any updates or any part thereof (except to the extent any foregoing restriction is permitted by applicable law or to the extent as may be permitted by the licensing terms governing use of any open sourced components included with the App). 
 
5.          Open Source Software.
 
Musubi may contain open source software components, each of which has its own copyright notice requirements and own applicable license conditions. These components are subject to the terms of third party open source licenses, and not the terms of this Agreement. A list of these components and the licenses that cover them can be found at: http://mobisocial.stanford.edu/musubi/foss.txt.  If any such license requires us to deliver the source code for such component to you, we will do so upon request at a nominal fee.
 
6.         Your Assignment to Us.
 
If you submit any comments or suggestions to us by means of Musubi, you hereby assign to us all right, title and interest in and to such comments or suggestions.  
 
7.         Termination and Survival. 
 
If you breach this Agreement, we may immediately terminate this Agreement, but all provisions of this Agreement except Section 3 (“License Grant”) will survive termination and continue in effect.  Upon termination, you must destroy all copies of Musubi.
 
8.          Proprietary Rights. 
 
We reserve all intellectual property rights in Musubi, except for the rights expressly granted in this Agreement.  You may not remove or alter any trademark, logo, copyright or other proprietary notice in or on the App.  This license does not grant you any right to use the trademarks, service marks or logos of Stanford MobiSocial or its licensors.
 
9.         Modification of this Agreement. 
 
Because of changes in technology and the growth and development of our business, or for other business reasons, we may need to modify this Agreement from time to time.  If we modify the Agreement, we will post a notice on http://mobisocial.stanford.edu/musubi/eula.html and display the new agreement on your Mobile Device screen the next time you open Musubi.  You must click to accept the revised agreement before you may continue to use Musubi.   You should regularly review this Agreement to ensure that you are informed of any changes.
